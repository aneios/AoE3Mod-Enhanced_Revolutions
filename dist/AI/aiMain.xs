   // Then we will call init() -> shared part.
   // SHARED PART:
   // Init() will create a TC build plan if we have a Covered Wagon start.
   // It will call initEcon() and initMil() to get those areas set up and it will
   // enable a bunch of Rules that don't require a TC to be alive and call postInit() from the loader file.
   // It will also enable the townCenterComplete Rule.
   // Inside of townCenterComplete we keep querying to see if we have a TC, we need this to actually make sense of it all.
   // If we find a TC we enable the bulk of the rules and actually start playing for real.
